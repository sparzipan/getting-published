      <p>You've spent years perfecting your book and you're dying to share it with others, but you've reached a fork in the road.</p>
      <p>These days, you don't necessarily have to wait to get published – the opportunity is there for you to Do It Yourself and join the tribe of indie authors.</p>
      <p><em>But is that necessarily the best option for you and your circumstances?</em></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>The information is aimed mainly at authors looking to self-publish in the UK, however, most of the steps are the same wherever you are.
      </p>
      <p>If you are outside the UK, two of the main differences will be to do with copyright law and ISBN numbers.</p>
      <p>I will provide links to resources for each type of publishing route so that you can find more in-depth information with which to bulk up your knowledge arsenal as you go along.</p>

      <h2>Pros of Self-Publishing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal development</strong> – the experience can be rewarding and will give you valuable skills and knowledge for future endeavours.</li>
<li><strong>Experience</strong> – if you have first self-published, it can help you to be accepted by a literary agent if you decide to go down the traditional publishing route for your next book.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing opportunities</strong> – if you write nonfiction, you are likely to be already involved with your target audience. This means you'll know people who will happily share the word about your upcoming book.</li>
<li>You may be well-known in your field at the offset – perhaps you have submitted pieces to magazines, guest blogs, columns, forums or professional circles.</li>
<li><strong>Support network</strong> – there is a supportive community of indie authors out there, with plenty of help, advice and networking opportunities. You will also find plenty of editors and other professionals dedicated to helping indie authors thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Social media</strong> – you’ll have the opportunity to build trust and a connection with your followers, which will encourage a desire to invest in your projects. If you feel this eats up too much of your time, you can learn to use a social media scheduler or work with an assistant.</li>
<li>Social media is a great way to connect with many people at a low cost.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong> – you will have full control over the process (for example, marketing, design and which professionals you'd like to work with, if any).</li>
<li><strong>Less risk</strong> – self-publishing allows you to 'print on demand'. This means there's less risk, and no wasted resources such as materials or money – the books are simply printed as they are ordered, and this can be done very quickly these days.</li>
<li>There is no struggle to pitch to a literary agent and face frustrating rejections.</li>
</ul>

      <div id="self-cons">
      <h2>Cons of Self-Publishing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Potential overwhelm</strong> – you, the author, will need to do all the work yourself or contract professionals to do it for you – everything from editing, interior and cover design, proofreading, illustrations, photography, marketing and publicity, accounting, indexing, manufacturing, fulfilling orders, shipping, sales, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Business savvy</strong> – self-publishing should be seen as running a business; all the relevant activities and responsibilities involved in being self-employed as an author and publisher will be down to you.</li>
<li><strong>You're accountable</strong> – having to wear many different hats can become overwhelming if all you want to do is to focus on writing.</li>
<li><strong>Research and learning</strong> – you will need to be committed in order to make the best of your self-publishing journey.</li>
<li><strong>Costs</strong> – these can be daunting – although there are various levels of expense, it can become a large investment with no guarantee to make a return.</li>
<li><strong>No mainstream exposure</strong> – if you decide you'd like your book to be available in major bookshops or libraries, this may not be an option if you self-publish.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Quick-Fire Self-Publishing Guide</h2>
      <h3>Initial Preparations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start off by asking yourself what your goal is as a result of self-publishing – what is your definition of it being a success? Do you want to sell x amount of copies? Do you just want to see your book in print? Do you want to see your book being recommended by certain organisations? Your production and marketing plan (and your budget) will depend on how you answer these questions.</li>
<li>See self-publishing as setting up and running a business; you will need a way of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-records" target="_blank">keeping a log of all your business expenses</a> – a simple Excel spreadsheet will suffice.</li>
<li><a href="https://publishdrive.com/self-publishing-costs/" target="_blank">Costs</a> – decide how much you are willing to do yourself as opposed to what you want to outsource; decide this first and begin to save up in advance. It is a good idea to see these initial expenses as an investment in your business and future. See my resources list for some helpful blogs that break down the potential costs and the various tiers of expense you could be looking at.</li>
<li>Have a <a href="https://selfpublishingadvice.org/how-do-i-market-my-first-book-askalli-members-qa-november-2018/" target="_blank">marketing plan</a> in place.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/what-are-the-guidelines-for-formating-a-manuscript" target="_blank">Prepare your manuscript</a>.</li>
<li>Get an <a href="http://www.isbn.nielsenbook.co.uk/" target="_blank">ISBN</a> – if you're publishing an eBook only, you don't necessarily need one, but for print books, you definitely need one. Remember that you will need a new one each time there is a new edition, an edition in another language or if you want to publish a hardback version, so you may be better off getting the package of 10 to start with, rather than a single one; it will be more cost-effective in the long run and gives you flexibility and control. See the resources list for links to where to buy these in the UK and the USA.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office" target="_blank">Copyright</a> – keep up to date with the latest laws and <a href="https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2009/10/self-publishing-basics-the-copyright-page/" target="_blank">the very minimum you need to include on your copyright page</a>. There are some handy links for both the UK and the USA in the resources.</li>
